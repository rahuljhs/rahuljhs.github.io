            Visualisation created on this website are part of project in curriculum of INFO-H517 at SOIC @ IUPUI

        <p><b>Datasets: </b>
            Datapoints represented on Visualisation
            <ul>
                <li><a style="color:black" href="datasets/streets.json"><span class="code">streets.json</span></a> - gives the coordinates of the streets as a series of line segments. The file is formatted as a JSON array or arrays; The higer-level array is essentailly a list of all street segments. Each street segment is, in turn, an array containing X,Y tuples represnting vertices of the segment.
                        <pre>
                        [
                            [	
                                // segment 1
                                {x1,y1}, 
                                {x2,y2}, 
                                {x3,y3}
                            ],
                        
                            [
                                // segment 2 
                                {x1,y1}, 
                                {x2,y2}
                            ],
                            ...
                        ]
                        </pre>
                        Here's how to visualize the street map: draw a series of lines connecting {x1,y1}, {x2,y2}, and {x3,y3}. This would give you one street segment. To draw the entire map, you would (individually) draw all of the segments in the file.</li>

                <li><a style="color:black" href="datasets/pumps.csv"><span class="code">pumps.csv</span></a> - gives the locations of the 13 nearby pumps</li>
                <li><a style="color:black" href="datasets/deathdays.csv"><span class="code">deathdays.csv</span></a> - gives the number of deaths for each day of the outbreak</li>
                <li><a style="color:black" href="datasets/deaths_age_sex.csv"><span class="code">deaths_age_sex.csv</span></a> - gives the location of each death in the deathdays file, in order, plus information on the age and sex of the victim.</li>

        <b>Project Deliverables:</b> A set of public web pages which includes following:
            <ul>
                <li> <b>1 page for the visualization itself:</b> This should be a <u>live, interactive version of the visualization you created</u>. It is important that the visualization works in the Chrome web browser - this is the platform that we will be using for evaluating your work.</li>
                <li> <b>1 documentation page</b> that describes your work and documents the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your design process: How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs / ideas you attempted in the beginning? A good way to document your design process is to scan your sketches and include them in the documentation page.</li>
                        <li>Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?</li>
                        <li>Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization. In this case, we have a clear hypothesis to start with, but are there other nuggets of insights one can uncover?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>A 2-4 minutes YouTube video</b> showing the use of your visualization with narration. This video should be embedded in your documentation page. The video should be created using a screen-capture tool while interacting with the visualization. It should ideally be similar in style to the videos that accompany papers at the IEEE VIS or ACM CHI conferences. Here are a couple of good examples: <a style="color:black" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfF2wGw7Qk">UpSet</a>, and <a style="color:black" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtbIeCvB-E0">GPLOM</a></li>
            </ul>
            The web pages should be live online, and your submission should consist of a single URL. The URL should open with the visualization itself. However, there should be a <b>clearly visible link</b> to the documentation page and the YouTube video.
